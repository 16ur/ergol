(Warning: GNU/Linux only.)

This Python script is an experimental XKB installer. It should be a good basis for a a distribution package (DEB, RPM, AURâ€¦) along with the snippets produced in the `/dist/xkb/` directory, or for a [standalone installation script](https://gist.github.com/fabi1cazenave/8c6dd36202852b3757412c908d0872f1).

A proper solution would be to implement this in [Kalamine](https://github.com/fabi1cazenave/kalamine) instead.
